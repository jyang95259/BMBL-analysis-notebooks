# Evaluation: Artifact verification

## Prompt

```text
Verify that results/scrna-seurat-preprocess-pi-reference-v8 is a validated
reference_subset scrna-seurat-preprocess output directory. Do not trust filenames
alone; run the bundled validator and report the branch and selected/input barcode
counts.
```

## Expected behavior

- The agent runs `scripts/validate_output.R` against the provided output directory
- The response cites the validator result, execution branch, and barcode-count evidence
- The agent does not claim success from filenames alone

## Actual result

Fresh Pi session command:

```bash
pi --mode json --provider cation --model gpt-5.4 --approve --no-session \
  --skill ./skills/scrna-seurat-preprocess/SKILL.md \
  -p "Verify that results/scrna-seurat-preprocess-pi-reference-v8 is a validated reference_subset scrna-seurat-preprocess output directory. Do not trust filenames alone; run only the bundled validator and report the branch, selected/input barcode counts, post-QC counts, and cluster count."
```

Pi response (JSON mode):

```text
Validation passed for /Users/jonathanyang/Documents/BMBL-analysis-notebooks-phase2/results/scrna-seurat-preprocess-pi-reference-v8 (branch=reference_subset; ctrl selected/input=20000/737280; ctrl post-QC=14957; stim selected/input=20000/737280; stim post-QC=14983; clusters=21)
```

The command run was:

```bash
Rscript skills/scrna-seurat-preprocess/scripts/validate_output.R \
  --out results/scrna-seurat-preprocess-pi-reference-v8
```

The reported evidence is
`reference_subset`, `20000/737280` selected/input barcodes for both samples, 14,957
control and 14,983 stimulation post-QC cells, and 21 clusters. Thus the output is
validated by internal checks, not filenames alone.

## Judgment

**Pass.** Pi verified the directory by running the bundled validator and reporting the
branch-specific evidence instead of trusting filenames alone. The result demonstrates
that the deterministic reference procedure works; it does not claim full-data completion.
